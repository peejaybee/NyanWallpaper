Nyan Cat Live Wallpaper

A simple live wallpaper.  A wholesale (with permission) ripoff of Jens' code from here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9158310/is-it-possible-to-set-an-animated-gif-file-as-live-wallpaper-in-android

All I did was add a little boilerplate to make it compilable.

Note: the app that this code builds was the object of a DMCA takedown in 2014 due to the unauthorized use of the Nyan Cat.  This code should work with any well-behaved animated GIF, and is here as an illustration.
